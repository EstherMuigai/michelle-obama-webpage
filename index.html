        <h1>WHY IS SHE SO OUTSTANDING?</h1>
        <p>I know I couldn't exhaust the number of ways in which Michelle Obama 
            is one of the most influential women of the 21st Century but I could try 
            all I can do is try</p>

        <h2>Michelle Obama's achievements</h2>
        <p>Being married to a man that was once the most powerful man alive, 
            President Barack Hussein Obama, you'd think that being that
             being the FLOTUS to his POTUS as she fondly puts it or the Renegade to 
             his Reneissance-their secret service code names-would be her greatest achievement. However, 
             even as President Barrack Obama insists, Michelle Obama was once Michelle Lavaughn Robinson, 
             an exceptionally bright girl from the South Side even before becoming Mrs.President</p>

            <li>In 2010 she passed The School Lunch program with bipartisan support. 
                The program provides free and reduced-price meals to more than 
                21 million low-income children, now requires districts to serve more fruit, 
                vegetables, whole grains, lean protein and low-fat dairy products.</li>

                <li>Also in 2010 she launched Let's Move! Michelle Obama said that her goal was to make this effort her legacy: 
                "I want to leave something behind that we can say, 
                'Because of this time that this person spent here, this thing has changed.' 
                And my hope is that that's going to be in the area of childhood obesity.</li>

            <li>And last but not least, how she won my heart with her book Becoming. 
                Michelle Obama is definitely a gifted writer</li>
